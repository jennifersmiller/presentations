Ch 5 - Repetition Structures, part 2
	At the end of this presentation you should be able to
		use a while loop to read a files using each of the following
			using extraction operator (>>)
			using get() and eof() 
			using getline() 
		explain when of each of those methods should be used 
------------------------------------------
Reading Files
	While loops can be used to read a file until eof (end-of-file) is reached.
		input stream returns false when eof has been reached
	A character by character read example using the extraction operator is as follows:
	[[code]]
		ifstream infile;
		char ch;
		&nbsp;
		infile.open("TextFile1.txt");
		infile >> ch;
		&nbsp;
		while (infile) {
			cout &lt;&lt; ch;
			infile >> ch;
		}
	Note: extraction operator skips white space so blanks will not be read...
-----------------------------------------------
Example 2
	Since the extraction operator returns a reference to itself, we can write the previous example even more tersely as shown below (we cover references later on)
	[[code]]
		ifstream infile;
		char ch;
		&nbsp;
		infile.open("TextFile1.txt");
		&nbsp;
		while (infile >> ch) {
			cout &lt;&lt; ch;
		}
		&nbsp;
	Isn't C++ great!
	While (answer != "Yes!) 
		Ask again "Isn't C++ great!"


-----------------------------------------------
eof() function
	The stream object end-of-file function (eof()) can be used to test for end of file as well
	eof() returns true if end-of-file has been reached
	This example is similar to the first example except it uses the eof and get functions.
	[[code]]
		ifstream infile;
		char ch;
		&nbsp;
		infile.open("TextFile1.txt");
		infile.get(ch);
		&nbsp;
		while (!infile.eof()) {
			cout &lt;&lt; ch;
			infile.get(ch);
		}
------------------------------------------
getline example
	getline can be used to read a file line by line
	getline will return false if it fails (reaches eof), so it can be used in the condition
	[[code]]
		ifstream infile;
		string line;
		&nbsp;
		infile.open("TextFile1.txt");
		&nbsp;
		while (getline(infile, line)) {
			cout &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; "\n";
		}
	Note: getline uses newline character as delimiter so they're not read.  Therefore a "\n" was "re-added" to the output after each line.

Ch 7 - User Defined Simple Data Types, Namespaces, and Strings
	User Defined Simple Data Types
		enumerated type
		typedef
	Namespaces
	C++ Strings
------------------------------------------
Enumerated type
	Sometimes, you'll have variables that can only have certain values, with each value having a specific meaning
		For example, in rock-paper-scissors, your hand can have one of three states: rock, paper, or sissors.
	You could use a char variable, and store 'r', 'p', or 's' for the three states.  
		Problems with this are:
			'r', 'p', and 's' aren't meaningful (you'd need comments somewhere describing them)
			There's the possibility of the state being invalid (e.g. 'z'?)
	An Enumerated type solves those issues.  
		An enumerated type
			defines the datatype used for variables to hold the state
			defines what the valid states are
		Code looks like this
		[[code]]
			enum HandState {ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS }
		This gives meaningful names to both the type and the states
---------------------------------------------
Enum Example
	Once an enumerated type is created
		you can create variables of that type
		assign those variables only the valid values
		compare variables of that type
	For example:
	[[code]]
		&nbsp;
		enum HandState {ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS};
		...
		&nbsp;
		HandState hand1 = ROCK;
		HandState hand2 = SCISSORS;
		&nbsp;	
		&nbsp;
		if (hand1 == ROCK && hand2 == SCISSORS)
			cout << "Rock smashes scissors!  Hand one wins!";
		else ....
	Doing other operations would require you cast the enumerated type as an int
		Each value is actually 0, 1, 2, etc..
------------------------------------------
typedef
	typedef allows you to "define" your own type, by giving an existing type a new name
		It's really just an alias
	For example:
		[[code]]
		&nbsp;
		typedef int integer;
		typedef bool boolean;
		...
		integer x = 2;
		boolean answer = true;
		...

-------------------------------------------
Namespaces
	Namespaces are used to solve the problem of overlapping global identifiers
	This was sometimes a problem when using third party libraries that had conflicting names
		each used the same name for something different
	For example, two vendors might both define funcX(), and you might be including both their header files
		Without namespaces, this would result in the 2nd attempting to redefine the first (compiler error)
		With namespaces, each can be in it's own namespace!
	You can specify a default namespace to look in with the "using namespace" keyword
		System stuff in iostream, cmath, and iomanip are defined in the namespace std, which is we typically state to look in that namespace by default:
		[[code]]
			using namespace std;
-------------------------------------------
namespace example
	To use something in a namespace that is not the default, you need to preface the items name with the namespace it's in:
	[[code]]
		namespace graphics {
			void funcX();
			...
		}
		namespace physics {
			void funcX();
			...
		}
		&nbsp;
		void main() {
			graphics::funcX();
			physics::funcX();
			...
		}
-------------------------------------------
Strings
	The string datatype is a structured data type (object) which allows you to more easily store and manipulate alphanumeric data (names, sentences, etc..)
	The string datatype exists in most languages
		It wasn't in C
		Prior to the ANSI/ISO C++ standard, it wasn't officially in C++ either but vendors typically provided one
		It is now part of the c++ language, and is very useful
	It supports
		assignment operator (at any time, not just initialization)
		comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=)
	and there are numerous methods you can use on strings
		[[http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/!www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/]]
-------------------------------------------
String Example
	[[code]]
		string name; 
		
		cout << "Enter your name: "; 
		getline(cin, name); [[desc getline reads  all characters up to a newline and puts them into the given string]]
		
		cout << "Your name contains " << name.length() << " chars"; [[desc the .length() function returns the length of the string]]
				
		if (name != "Bob") [[desc strings can be compared using all the comparison operators]]
			cout << "Your name is not Bob." << endl;
			
		cout << "The first letter of your name is " << name[0] << endl; [[desc You can treat the string like a character array to access individiual characters.<br>There's also a .at() function that accomplishes the same thing.]]
		
		name="Bob"; [[desc You can use the assignment operator on strings even after they're declared.]]

<h2> Course Info</h2>

<p><b>Course Description:</b>  Disciplined approach to algorithm development, problem-solving methods, program design, data types, control structures, and subprograms. Uses C++.</p>

 <p>This is the first course of a three term sequence, and is commonly required by all computer science, computer engineering and electrical engineering majors. It covers algorithm development, problem solving methods, program design, data types, control structures and functions using C++.  In addition the course includes a broad overview of the computer science discipline. (4 credits)</p>

<p><b>Course Objectives:</b> Upon completion of this course, each student should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain what a computer algorithm is and create algorithms to solve problems</li>
<li>List and describe several software design methodologies</li>
<li>Utilize the top-down design methodology to decompose a complex problem. </li>
<li>Apply a Computer Program Design Process to simple programming problems.</li>
<li>Specify, design, implement, debug and document simple programs using C++. </li>
<li>Use a modern programming environment to edit, compile, debug and execute C++ programs</li>
<li>Correctly uses variables, constants, functions, if-then statements, while loops, for loops, switch statements. </li>
<li>Describe and correctly use call-by-value and call-by-reference parameters. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> CS120 and Math 111 (or 4 years of High School math)</p>

<p>The class is a combination of theory and practice. The student will use the textbook, the WWW, homework assignments, and interaction with the instructor and fellow students to gain insight into the topics covered. Because of the collaborative nature of the class, and the fact that material may may be presented that is not in the textbook, regularly attending class is essential.</p>

<!-- =========== Instructor ============ -->
<div id="Instructor" class="Content">
<h2> Instructor Info</h2>
<p><b>Name: &nbsp;</b>Richard Albers<br />
<b>Email:&nbsp;</b> richa@clackamas.edu<br />
<b>Office:</b> Streeter - S126<br />
<b>Hours:</b> MW 1:00-2:00, TuTh 3:00-4:00, or by appointment<br />
<b>Phone:</b> 503-594-3166 (email is preferred)</p>

<p>I have an A.A.S. in Data Processing, a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Systems Engineering, and am proficient in several programming langauges.  Prior to becomming a full-time College Instructor, I worked as a software developer/engineer in a variety of industries on a number of different types of projects, ranging from applications development on Windows to systems programming on the HP-UX Kernel.</p>
</div>

<!-- =========== Materials ============ -->
<div id="Materials" class="Content">
<h2> Materials</h2>
<p><b>Textbook:</b> C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures by D.S. Malik.  Any edition from 3rd through 7th is OK.</p>

<p><b>Website:</b> We will be using Moodle for announcements, distribution of class materials, quizzes, and the final exam. Your Moodle login is the same as your myClackamas login, and the login page can be found at:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://online.clackamas.edu" target="_blank">http://online.clackamas.edu</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Development Environment:</b> - You'll need access to a C++ development environment.  In class we'll be using Visual Studio 2015 (Microsoft's Integrated Development Environment) to write, debug, and test our programs.  You can get a copy of the Professional version through Microsoft Developers Network Academic Alliance (of which CCC is a part) by sending an email to Eric Mcbride (whose office is here in the annex) as follows <b>from your clackamas.edu email address</b>:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>To:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cssoftware@clackamas.edu<br>
<b>Subject:</b> Imagine Access - CS161<br>
	The body must contain your <b>Name</b>, <b>Student ID number</b>, and course number <b>CS161</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: Visual Studio only runs on Windows.  However, there are other C++ development environments for other platforms (linux or Mac) so you can use one those as well (at home) if you don't have a Windows machine. Please see me (the instructor) if you plan on doing that as the projects will not be compatible with the development environment I use in my office.</p> 

</div>

<!-- =========== Grading ============ -->
<div id="Grading" class="Content">
<h2> Grading</h2>
<p>Graded work will consist of assignments, quizzes, and a final exam, weighted as follows:</p>

<table align="center">
<tr><td>Assignments (mostly programs):</td>	<td>40%</td></tr>		
<tr><td>Quizzes:</td>		<td>20%</td></tr>	
<tr><td>Final Exam:</td>		<td>40%</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Assignments:</b>   There will be numerous assignments (mostly programs) given throughout the term.   Some of your work will be code-reviewed by your peers, and some will be submitted for a grade.   These assignments, ideally, will be done independently, but you may discuss the assignment with other class members to get clarification and/or assistance.  However, keep in mind the goal of the class is to learn (not just write a bunch of code) so make sure you fully understand all the code you write.  If you simply copy someone else's work, both you and the person from whom you copied will, at a minimum, receive a zero on the assignment, and more importantly, you'll learn very little, be ill-prepared for the future, and simply waste a bunch of your time.  Due dates and times will be posted and assignments will be submitted via Moodle.  Late programs will have a substantial penalty (at least 5% per calendar day). </p>

<p><b>Review Quizzes:</b> After reading the chapter, you should take the <a href="https://richalbers.github.io/quiz/Quiz.html?id=1Rmme2BE6gXxGlb8rWiozAw-mBRerrb0nS2QSBysZWYg" target="_blank">interactive review quizzes</a> for the chapter.  While the grades on these will not be recorded, similar (or identical!) questions will appear on the in-class chapter quiz.</p>

<p><b>In-class Quizzes:</b> Each week, there will be a quiz over the previous weeks content.  The questions on this quiz will mostly be similar to those on the review quizzes (see above).  This quiz must be taken in class.  </p>
   
<p><b>Exam:</b> A final exam will be given. Details of the exams will be specified in class. </p>

<p>
Grading scale: 90%-100% = A, 80%-89.9% = B, 70%-79.9% = C, 60%-69.9% = D, &lt; 60% = F
</p>
</div>

<!-- =========== Misc ============ -->
<div id="Misc" class="Content">
<h2> Misc</h2>
<p><b>Attendance:</b> Regular attendance is essential to your success in this course. Students are responsible for everything that takes place during class, whether covered in written materials or not.  Additionally, some of each class day will be devoted to hand-on activities, and if a class must be missed, there will not be time to make up those activities in the future.</p>

<p><b>Professionalism:</b> All participants in the class will are required to conduct themselves in a courteous, professional manner at all times. This includes communications in person, via phone, via e-mail or through an online chat or discussion.</p>

<p><b>Ethics: </b>Plagiarism or cheating of any variety will be dealt with in accordance with the policies expressed in the student handbook. Possible consequences for academic dishonesty are: receiving no credit for the assignment in question, failing the course, and/or appearing before the college disciplinary board.</p>

<p><b>Food / Drink Policy:</b> Eating is not allowed while class is in session.  Drinking beverages is acceptable provided the beverage is in a sealable container and you aren't interfering with the learning environment of the class.</p>

<p><b>Cell Phones:</b> Cell phones should not interfere with the learning environment of the class.  If your phone disrupts class, you may have points deducted from your grade.  If you believe you must have your phone on during class, please discuss this with the instructor before class begins to see if an exception will be allowed.</p>

<p><b>Classroom Computer Use:</b> Classroom computer use (your own or the schools) should be restricted to activities related to course content.  The computers should not be used for games, or any other activities that may disrupt those around you while class is in session.  Violations of this policy may result in points being deducted from your grade and/or you being asked to leave the class. </p>
	
<p><b>Special Needs:</b> If you are a student with a disability and you believe that your opportunities to be successful in this class are affected by that disability, please contact the Clackamas CC Disability Resource Center.  Their website is <a href="http://www.clackamas.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/" target="_blank">http://www.clackamas.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Incomplete Grades:</b>  An incomplete grade can be given at the discretion of the instructor if you have satisfactorily (C or better) completed at least 75% of the class work. Arrangements must be made with the instructor before finals week in order to be considered for an incomplete.</p>

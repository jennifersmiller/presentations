	This presentation covers
		Why we may want to use 3rd party libraries
		What they contain
		How to download and install SFML
		Static vs Dynamic linking
		Where Dynamic Libraries should be located
		How to configure a project to use SFML
------------------------------------------
Introduction
	C++, like many languages, provides the basic building blocks to construct applications to do just about anything you can do with software.
		But the stuff provided by the language is relatively simple.
		Doing complex things, such as those listed here, requires lots of low-level code.
			Graphics (2D and/or 3D)
			Physics engines (mathematically modelling the real world)
			Game Engines (graphics/sound/networking/etc...)
	To keep everyone from having to write all this code themselves (ie. "re-inventing the wheel"), there are many available 3rd party packages you can get that provide this high-level functionality.  
		These are a type of SDK (Software Development Kit)
		Some are free. Some are not.
	Here's a [[list of game engines!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines]] available for various languages.
		Most are written in C/C++ for performance reasons. 
---------------------------------------------
What's in a 3rd Party Package
	Header Files
		Contain the definitions and prototypes for all the items (classes/prototypes/etc..) provided by the package
		These will need to be 
			put somewhere on disk where your build environment (IDE) can access them
			included in your source files via #include statements
	Libraries
		Contains the implementation (compiled code) for all the classes and/or functions provided by the package
		These will need to be 
			put somewhere on disk where your build environment (IDE) can access them
			linked with your code by configuring your project properties
	Documentation
		Descriptions of the Classes and Functions and how to use them (usually web pages)

----------------------------------------------
Practice
	We'll now download and look at an example of a 3rd party game engine: [[SFML!http://www.sfml-dev.org/]]
		SFML is a Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for game development
	Download the latest version of the SFML game engine
		Do a Google search for SFML (or click the link above)
		Choose the one for building 32 bit Windows applications
		Save it to the C Drive (C:\)
	Look at the download file to see what it contains
		Note: SFML is open-source so in addition to the include files, libraries, and documentation, you can get all the source files used to build the libraries if you wanted to.		

----------------------------------------------
Installing SFML
	After downloading SFML, you'd need to "install it" in order to use it
		Google "SFML installation"
	According to [[the SFML Visual Studio instructions!http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php]]
		"You can then unpack the SFML archive wherever you like. Copying headers and libraries to your installation of Visual Studio is not recommended, it's better to keep libraries in their own separate location, especially if you intend to use several versions of the same library, or several compilers"
	For the classroom computers
		The entire package was unpacked into C:\SFML-2.3.2
		We then copy the dynamic libraries (*.dll files) from C:\SFML-2.3.2\bin into C:\Windows\SysWOW64
			Dynamic Libraries are discussed next
---------------------------------------------
Static vs Dynamic Linking
	Libraries can be linked two ways:
		Static
			These are linked at build time and the code from the library is put into the executable (.exe)
			Doing static linking makes your executable larger, but it then "stands alone" and doesn't require other files to run
		Dynamic
			These are not combined with your .exe; they're stored on disk as separate files (.dll's)
			They are linked at run time, when your program needs them
			The Operating System loads them into memory when your executable (.exe) calls the routines contained within
			This makes a smaller .exe, but the .dll's must be available at run-time for your .exe to run
	Your project will specify how you're going to link the libraries.  
		You can change the method during development.
---------------------------------------------
Dynamically Linked Library Location
	When using dynamic linking, Windows will look is certain locations for the .dlls as described here:
		[[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7d83bc18.aspx!http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7d83bc18.aspx]]
		Note: the "PATH" can be viewed using the path command from the cmd prompt
	On 64 bit machines, 32bit and 64bit .dlls are stored in different locations
		\Windows\System32 will contain 64 bit versions
		\Windows\SysWOW64 will contain 32 bit versions
		Yes, this seems backwards, but it's the way it is.
	Note: Unless your app needs more than 4GB of RAM, it should be compiled as 32bit, that way it can run on both 32 and 64 bit machines
-------------------------------------------
SFML Project Configuration
	To use SFML in your project, you'll need to configure a project as described here:
		[[http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/start-vc.php!http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/start-vc.php]]	
	Notes:
		In the example at the link above:
			It references drive D:, you'll most likely be using C:
			The Linker "Additional Dependencies" need to be ; delimited (the example shows them space delimited)
		If using dynamic linking, the SFML .dlls need to be in one of the locations specified by the previous slide
			Classroom computers can have them in the SysWOW64 folder
			The project folder with your .exe might have been a better choice 
			Static linking might be the best choice of all when it's all done.
-------------------------------------------
Practice
	If you haven't already done so, verify the location of the header files and .dlls. 
		On the classroom computers:
			header files are in C:\SFML-2.3.2\include
			copies of the .dlls are in C:\Windows\SysWOW64
				Go there and look for files beginning with "sfml-"
	Create a console project
		configure it as specified in the previous slide
		cut and paste the given code into a source file in your project
		verify it will compile and run
		debug it (project settings) until it works
